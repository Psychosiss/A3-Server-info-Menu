###ArmA 3 Server info Menu by IT07

First of all: it is really hard as a coder to explain someone how to install scripts. So please bare with me.<br />
<br />
#### INSTALLATION
Open code_for_init.sqf that is located inside this repository and copy over the code to your own init.sqf<br />
If you own previous versions, please delete all of the files associated with it or merge.<br />
Also, add these two lines to your description.ext: <br />
`#include "ScarCode\gui_SC\sMenuCommon.hpp"` <br />
`#include "ScarCode\gui_SC\sMenuConfig.hpp"` <br />

#### CONFIGURATION
To configure the menu, please check sMenuConfig.hpp (inside the ScarCode\gui_SC folder) and read CAREFULLY!<br />
NOTE: there are several images included with the menu that represent several server hosting companies.<br />
Feel free to delete the images you do not need or add one yourself :)
<br />
#### BATTLEYE
For people that use BE Filters, look in the file named BEcustom.txt and simply merge the contents of it with your own scripts.txt.<br />
The custom BE code has only been tested on ArmA 3 Epoch 2.3.0.3!<br />
